# Contributing

## Setup

- Install stable Rust.
- Run `cargo build`.

## Before opening a PR

- Run all required local checks:
  - `./scripts/precheck.sh`
- Run Linux tests via helper script (if you don't develop on Linux):
  - `./scripts/run-linux-docker-test.sh`

## PR expectations

- Keep changes focused.
- Update docs for behavior or flag changes.
- Add/adjust tests for behavior changes.

## Release workflow (cargo-dist)

- Release artifacts are built/published by `.github/workflows/release.yml` (generated by `cargo-dist`).
- Keep `Cargo.toml` version and release tag aligned (`vX.Y.Z`).
- With PR-protected `main`, tag from a commit that is already merged to `main`.

## Coverage report

- Generate HTML coverage report:
  - `cargo llvm-cov --all-targets --html`
- Open report:
  - `open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html` (macOS)
